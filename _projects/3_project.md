In this project, I addressed the limitations of traditional speech recognition systems, which often struggle with accent and dialect variations, especially in linguistically diverse languages like English. Utilizing transformer-based models such as Wave2Vec 2.0, Whisper, and HuBERT, I developed a novel approach that integrates accent and dialect classification directly into the speech recognition pipeline. By masking accent embeddings from a English dataset, the system effectively increases performance in accented speech recognition. This solution demonstrates improved robustness over baseline models, making speech recognition more accurate and inclusive of diverse linguistic variations.
