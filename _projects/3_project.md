In this project, under the supervision of Professor Sameti, I tackled the limitations of traditional speech recognition systems, particularly their struggles with recognizing accents in diverse languages like English. Leveraging transformer-based models such as Wave2Vec 2.0, Whisper, and HuBERT, I developed an innovative approach that integrates accent classification into the speech recognition pipeline. By strategically masking accent embeddings from an English dataset, the system significantly improves recognition performance for accented speech. This solution enhances the robustness of speech recognition models, making them more accurate and inclusive of diverse linguistic variations.
