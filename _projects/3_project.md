In this project where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Menze at University of Zurich, I aimed to register images from two modalities: MRA and CTA. The main challenge is the lack of datasets of pairs of CTA and MRA for the same patient and also the gap in literature for this area.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
