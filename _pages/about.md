I am Sepehr Harfi, a final-year BSc Computer Engineering student at [Sharif University of Technology](http://sharif.edu) with a passion for research, with no specific order, in trustworthy machine learning, music information retrieval, speech and audio processing, AI for health, and fairness in AI. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy exploring music, pyschology, cinema, and arts, which fuel my creativity.
