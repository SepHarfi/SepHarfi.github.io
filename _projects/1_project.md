In this project, conducted under the supervision of Professor Menze at the University of Zurich, I focused on developing a registration framework for images from two different medical imaging modalities: Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). The primary challenge was the scarcity of datasets containing paired MRA and CTA images from the same patients, along with the limited research available in this specific field. This project tackled these obstacles, contributing to the advancement of multimodal image registration in the medical imaging domain.
