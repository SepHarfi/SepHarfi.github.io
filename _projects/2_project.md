In this project, conducted under the supervision of Professor Lotfollahi at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, I focused on predicting the age of single cells based on their gene expression profiles. The main challenges were the high dimensionality of the data. To address these, I employed the GeneFormer model, a transformer-based architecture designed to embed gene expression data, followed by regression heads for age prediction. I evaluated GeneFormer's performance for this task and applied advanced techniques like mix-up loss to enhance the model's accuracy and overall performance.
