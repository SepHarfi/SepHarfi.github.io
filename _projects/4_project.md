In collaboration with Professors Soleymani Baghshah and Javidpour, this project focused on constructing a comprehensive dataset for Persian music generation. Additionally, we work on fine-tuning state-of-the-art models to effectively generate music in the Persian style. By addressing the unique characteristics of Persian music, the project aimed to enhance model performance and create a foundation for further advancements in AI-driven music generation within this cultural context.
