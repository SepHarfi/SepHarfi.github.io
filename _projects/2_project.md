In this project where I worked under the supervision of Professor Lotfollahi at Wellcome Sanger Institute, I aimed to predict a single cell's age based on its gene expression. The challenges here are the sparsity of our data and its high dimensionality. The solution proposed was using GeneFormer transformer-based model to embed our data and then use regression heads. In fact, I evaluated the GeneFormer results for this task. Furthermore, I used a bunch of techniques like mix-up loss to improve the performance of our model.
