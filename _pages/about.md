I am Sepehr Harfi, a final-year BSc Computer Engineering student at [Sharif University of Technology](http://sharif.edu) with a passion for research in trustworthy machine learning, speech and audio processing with a focus on music, and AI for health. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy exploring music, pyschology, cinema, and arts, which fuel my creativity.
