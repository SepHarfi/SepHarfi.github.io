I am Sepehr Harfi, a final-year BSc Computer Engineering student at [Sharif University of Technology](http://sharif.edu) with a passion for research in trustworthy machine learning, biomedical informatics, and medical image analysis. Outside of academia, I enjoy exploring music, pyschology, cinema, and the arts, which fuel my creativity.
